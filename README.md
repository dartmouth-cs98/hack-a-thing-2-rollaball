# Hack-a-thing-2: Rollaball

### Description
I followed a Unity Project (around 8 separate tutorials) to create a simple rolling ball game. The project serves as an introduction to creating game objects, collectibles, building planes, and having everything work together. The user controls the ball's movements to pick up collectibles and score points. The player wins when all the collectibles have been triggered.

This is the first time I have used Unity or coded in C# so this served as a good intro to the tech stack we will use for FaceTim3d.

The project I followed can be found on Unity Learn at https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2019.4

### What I Learned
I learned how to navigate the Unity Editor and write simple scripts in C#. I learned the hierarchy of objects in the Unity Editor and how to have different objects interact with each other. I also learned a UI component of Unity with displaying and updating the player's score.

### How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
This inspires me with possible UI options to add to our project. This also taught me how we might work with player inputs and how we might deal with different objects interacting with each other in a VR space.

### What didn't work
Using the platform and working with C# for the first time was challenging. I also ran into many problems with installing the software and also creating a Build at the end that used the right packages for backend deployment.
